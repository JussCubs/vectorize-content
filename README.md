# 🔵 Vectorizer - Meme Branding Tool  

This **Streamlit app** allows you to **upload an image** and applies the **Figma-style blue branding process** automatically. It adds a **blue background (`#0100FF`)**, **grayscales the image**, and **blends them together** to match the marketing branding standard. 🚀

## 🎨 How It Works
1. **Upload an image** (PNG/JPG/JPEG).  
2. The app **desaturates** it (grayscale).  
3. A **blue background (#0100FF)** is applied.  
4. The image and blue layer are **blended (luminosity effect)**.  
5. The final **vectorized image is displayed** and available for **download**.
